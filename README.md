Queue Implementation in C++ (Pointer Version)
Description
This project is a basic implementation of a queue data structure using pointers in C++. It does not rely on any external libraries like std::queue. The queue is implemented as a linked list, where each element is dynamically allocated, and memory is managed manually.

Features:
Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
Peek: View the element at the front without removing it.
Dynamic Memory Management: The queue can grow dynamically as needed, as it uses linked list nodes instead of a fixed-size array.
Pointer-based Implementation: The queue is built from scratch using pointers and manual memory allocation.
